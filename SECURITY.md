# Security Policy

**VIS-Cipher Advanced: Security Policy for Demonstration Project**

**Important: VIS-Cipher Advanced is a demonstration for educational purposes only and is NOT intended for production use. It has not undergone professional security auditing and should NOT be used to protect real-world sensitive data. This security policy reflects the nature of this project as a demonstration and not as a production-ready security product.**

## Supported Versions

As VIS-Cipher Advanced is a demonstration project, there are no formally "supported versions" in the traditional sense of ongoing security updates and patches for different releases.

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Current Version (as of February 20, 2025) | :white_check_mark: | **Limited - Best Effort for Demonstration Purposes Only** |

**Explanation:**

*   **Limited Support:**  "Supported" in this context means that the current version of VIS-Cipher Advanced available in this repository is provided "as-is" as a demonstration.  While I appreciate feedback and vulnerability reports (see below), **there is no guarantee of security updates or fixes in the way you would expect for a production security library or application.**
*   **No Backwards Compatibility/Older Versions:**  There are no officially supported older versions. I do not maintain backwards compatibility for security fixes across different versions of this demonstration project.
*   **Focus on Educational Value:**  The primary goal of this project is educational. Any efforts to address reported vulnerabilities will be focused on improving the demonstration and learning experience, not on providing production-grade security.

**For Production Use:**

**Again, I strongly reiterate: DO NOT use VIS-Cipher Advanced in any production environment or to protect real-world sensitive data. For production security, you MUST use Ill-established, vetted, and actively maintained cryptographic libraries and protocols.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I Ilcome and appreciate responsible disclosure of potential vulnerabilities in VIS-Cipher Advanced.  While this is a demonstration project, reporting vulnerabilities helps improve the educational value and understanding of secure coding practices.

**How to Report:**

Please report any potential security vulnerabilities via **GitHub Issues** in this repository.

**Steps to Report:**

1.  **Create a new Issue:** Go to the "Issues" tab in this GitHub repository and click "New issue."
2.  **Choose a descriptive title:**  Use a clear and informative title that summarizes the vulnerability (e.g., "Potential Timing Attack Vulnerability in Key Derivation").
3.  **Provide detailed information:** In the issue description, please include:
    *   **Description of the vulnerability:** Explain the potential security issue in detail.
    *   **Steps to reproduce:** If possible, provide clear steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Code snippets or examples are highly helpful.
    *   **Potential impact:** Describe the potential security impact of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected code:**  Point to the specific code sections that are relevant to the vulnerability.
    *   **Your contact information (optional):** If you wish to be contacted for further clarification, please provide your email address or GitHub username.

**What to Expect:**

*   **Acknowledgement:** I will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible, typically within a few business days.
*   **Evaluation:** I will evaluate the reported vulnerability to understand its nature and potential impact within the context of this demonstration project.
*   **Response Time:**  Due to the nature of this project as a demonstration and not a production system, **I cannot provide a guaranteed timeline for response or fixes.** Our ability to address vulnerabilities will depend on available time and resources.
*   **Fixes (Best Effort):**  If a reported vulnerability is confirmed and deemed relevant to the educational goals of the project, I will make a best-effort attempt to address it in the demonstration code. HoIver, **fixes are not guaranteed.**
*   **Public Disclosure:** I prefer responsible coordinated disclosure. Please allow us reasonable time to evaluate and potentially address the vulnerability before public disclosure. I will discuss disclosure timelines with you after evaluating the report.
*   **No Monetary Rewards/Bug Bounties:** As this is an educational demonstration project, I do not offer monetary rewards or bug bounties for vulnerability reports. I appreciate your contribution to improving the project's educational value.

**Important Disclaimer:**

By reporting a vulnerability, you understand and agree that VIS-Cipher Advanced is a demonstration project and not intended for production use. You acknowledge that any fixes provided are for educational purposes and do not constitute a guarantee of security for real-world applications.

**Thank you for helping us improve VIS-Cipher Advanced as an educational resource!**
